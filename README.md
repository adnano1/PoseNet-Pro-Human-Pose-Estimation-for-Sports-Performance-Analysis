# PoseNet Pro: Human Pose Estimation for Sports Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
PoseNet Pro is a human pose estimation project designed to analyze sports performance using advanced computer vision techniques. This project utilizes the PoseNet model to detect human keypoints in real-time, enabling athletes and coaches to assess performance metrics.

## Features
- **Real-time Pose Detection**: Detect human poses in video streams or images.
- **Keypoint Visualization**: Visualize keypoints on detected poses.
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze sports performance based on pose metrics.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable for various sports and performance metrics.

## Dataset
This project uses the **AIHub's Pose Dataset**, which contains annotated images of athletes performing various sports activities. The dataset includes:
- Image files
- Keypoint annotations in JSON format

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnano1/PoseNet-Pro-Human-Pose-Estimation-for-Sports-Performance-Analysis.git
   cd PoseNet-Pro-Human-Pose-Estimation-for-Sports-Performance-Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset by modifying the `dataset.py` file with the correct paths.
2. Run the main script to start pose estimation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to analyze sports performance.
