# PoseNet Pro: Human Pose Estimation for Sports Performance Analysis
 
## Project Overview
PoseNet Pro is a human pose estimation project designed to analyze sports performance using advanced computer vision techniques. This project utilizes the PoseNet model to detect human keypoints in real-time, enabling athletes and coaches to assess performance metrics.

## Features
- Real-time Pose Detection: Detect human poses in video streams or images.
- Keypoint Visualization: Visualize keypoints on detected poses.
- Performance Analysis: Analyze sports performance based on pose metrics.
- Customizable: Adaptable for various sports and performance metrics.

## Dataset 
This project uses the AIHub's Pose Dataset, which contains annotated images of athletes performing various sports activities. The dataset includes:
- Image files
- Keypoint annotations in JSON format

## Installation
